# Greenhouse Gas Emissions Indicator Using Machine Learning

The project's goal is to explore various predictive Machine Learning (ML) models and examine their prowess in being able to predict the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions of a country in a target year using the historical data of multiple environmental indicators and data features.

This Python program consists of multiple Machine Learning models and analyses that can predict our target variable, GHG Emissions. The code file was created using Google Colaboratory and may be run through the same program or alternatives such as Jupyter Notebook. 

This project was completed over 3 distinctive milestones. 

Milestone 1: Research Question, State of the Art, Data Exploration.

Milestone 2: Linear Regression, Multivariate Regressions, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Bagging, Comparative Anaylsis

Milestone 3: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Neural Networks, Clustering, Comparative Anaylsis
